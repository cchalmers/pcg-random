name:                pcg-random
version:             0.1.4.0
synopsis:            Haskell bindings to the PCG random number generator.
description:
  PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good
  algorithms for random number generation. Unlike many general-purpose
  RNGs, they are also hard to predict.
  .
  This library implements bindings to the standard C implementation.
  This includes the standard, unique, fast and single variants in the
  pcg family. There is a pure implementation that can be used as a
  generator with the random package as well as a faster primitive api
  that includes functions for generating common types.
  .
  The generators in this module are suitable for use in parallel but
  make sure threads don't share the same generator or things will go
  horribly wrong.
